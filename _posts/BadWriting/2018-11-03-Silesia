Silesia is a color.
Turquoise dye,
Green side trees
Azure lucid sky.
White clay reflections
Of the ground.
Silesia tastes
Narrowly fatty,
Cold at the bottom,
Sparkling batty.
Your hands in endless
Tepid top.
Jump with blast-off,
Concrete block hop.
Somersault,
Splashdown,
Scorching drop,
Perfect circles on the surface.
Silesia is the overcrowd peninsula,
Made from a construction sand,
With garbage piles around strand.
Armature and high voltage wires,
Whipping on bicycle lines.
