Two weeks and no tickets,  
Call the box-office, online selling is closed.  
There is always a reward,  
For someone who is stubborn and focused,  
From a nice woman in a blue outfit,  
Balcony, row twenty two, place four.  
And the hall is free on a quarter.  
  
Choir girl.  
Her head is moving in sound foam,  
Warm bath of the strings and basses,  
Howl, moan!  
Sink white hair in my shoulders.  
Pouring out red skirt and sharp jacket,  
Gloria! Gloria! Gloria!  
She is turning pages,  
Pulling the hair behind left ear.  
Following trousers of the director,  
Woman in black, the evening seer,  
She sets the mood of the crowd.  

Subtle soprano note,  
From a nightingale inside my chest,  
Locked up, deaf and dumbfounded,  
in black soundbreaker triangles nest,  

Nightingale is suffocating,  
In allowed permissions doom.  
Open the chest at night dating,  
Let him sing, pumping blood around the room,  
While everyday duties are loosing powers,  
Protect him from darkness behind,  
Let him guide your hand and pick flowers,  
Pink for love, white for innocence, green for joy.  
Chase the moment with a red tie,  
Listening to Mozart,  
Coronation Mass in C major.
