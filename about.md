My name is Andrii Shylenko.
This blog is about Embedded Software development from the proof of concept to the manufacturing phase, books, robots, writing and other topics I am fascinated with. 

### About me

As an R&D engeneer at [ifm ecolink](https://www.ifm.com) I have a lot of experience in the research and design of industry projects based on the core technology of the Industrial IoT, IO-Link. 
At spare time I do 3d printing, salsa dancing, massage therapy and public speaking.
