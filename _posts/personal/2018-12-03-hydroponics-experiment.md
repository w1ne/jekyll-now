As part of my letter trend of organic diet I am starting an experiment on the hydroponics growing. The ability to be self suficient and eat own grown food is futuristic but in the same time old as human kind.

We are the information and food we consume. Hydroponics is an easy way to tweak nutrients in the food as well as taste, chemical contents, growing perfomance. 

# Goal
The goal of the experiment is to gain knowledge in the how far I can go in automatic gardening and food production.

This post will contain a build log for indoor hydroponics system.

For the first build Nutrient Film Technique system was choosen as easy to make and effective design.  
# NFT system design

Part list for simple NFT system is listed below
