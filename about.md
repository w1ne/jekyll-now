My name is Andrii Shylenko and I am Embedded Software Engineer at [ifm ecolink](https://www.ifm.com) and PhD student at [Opole University of Technology(OUTech)](http://www.po.opole.pl).

This blog is about my work and study. [Teaching](http://n1n3.net/teaching/) section contains course materials for my teaching practice at OUTech.

### About me
