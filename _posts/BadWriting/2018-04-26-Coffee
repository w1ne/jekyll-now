Push pedals harder on beating time
Add to the bill, cross double line

Speed is swelling while coffee roasts
Woman killed God, mind coasts.

Google knows better where you're going
Spirit of apples, sepia crowing

Six grams shot, milled and boiled
Marine sneakers, rubbing on toe,
The song is groovy, the shirt boasts

See many faces but know minds,
Pupils lack light and shift to the rights,
Are you sure you want to stay night?

The drink is sweet and the dance floor is still
You never step when the rhythm is ill.
